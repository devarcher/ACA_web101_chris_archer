      <p>How meta! This portfolio page is my first Grid based page. Right now it showcases a few things I've made to date, but later, it will totally rock.</p>

        <p>Here was my first responisve landing page! This was done with out Grid.  Ohhh. Floats, you brought me such joy.  I'll never forget the hours we spent together. You'll always have a special place in my notes.</p>

        <p>Keanu Reeves. He's pretty cool, so I made a resume layout that covers some of his career highglights.  This wasn't responsive at the time. Hopefully I'll be able to revisit this soon with Grid and make it great!</p>

        <p>The coupons challenge.  A challenge indeed. This was my no-so-silk-gloved introduction to grid.  This layout was given to us to replicate. I'm happy with how it turned out. I was able to get it pretty close.  I wonder how quickly I'll be able to get it done a year from now.</p>

        <p>This was a fun mobile-first project incorporating both grid and flexbox. Looking forward to learning how to make the back end of one of these beauties.</p>

        <p>Men's fine grooming. That is what this project was all about.  The class assignment was to replicate this site from the internet.  I'm happy with how it turned out. It was a mobile first design that scaled up nicely.</p>
